# ATS800B

The ATS800B system is based on a compact antenna test range (CATR) using a paraboloid reflector with a dualpolarization feed antenna placed at its single focal point to
transform a spherical wavefront into a planar wave distribution and vice versa.
With the compact dimension, the measurement system can stand on a bench lab bench, enabling radiation measurement at millimeter waves in a user-friendly environment.
The compact range has been designed for optimal operation in the 20-50GHz bands.
A rotational stage from PI motor is available to rotate the Antenna Under Test (AUT) during measurement.
One objective of this repo will be to provide know-how to extend the capabilities of the actual system.

# Measurement Equipments for antenna measurement

The optimal equipment to measure antenna with AT800B is a Vector Network Analyser. We are using a two ports ZNA67 with external connector option.
