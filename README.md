Author: Omar Bouchenak Khelladi, Fabien Ferrero and Lionel Tombakdjian

This board was developed for education to support courses on embedded software, digital and analog electronic, telecommunication, signal processing and IoT.

# ATS800B

The ATS800B system is based on a compact antenna test range (CATR) using a paraboloid reflector with a dualpolarization feed antenna placed at its single focal point to
transform a spherical wavefront into a planar wave distribution and vice versa.
With the compact dimension, the measurement system can stand on a bench lab bench, enabling radiation measurement at millimeter waves in a user-friendly environment.
The compact range has been designed for optimal operation in the 20-50GHz bands.
One objectif of this repo will be to provide know-how to extend the capabilities of the actual system
